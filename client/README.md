This was a project I decided to undertake to learn the MERN stack. I followed Brad Traversy's tutorial on youtube and find it amazing. the knowledge that I have gained about development is amazing for such a free course. The tutorial was completed in 4 days up to authorisation with JWT.  

###What was learned from this project?

###MongoDB
How to use MongoDB, creating clusters, accessing db

###Postman
How to use Postman desktop application to test api endpoints including GET, POST and DELETE. This was my first time using Postman

###Mongoose

###ExpressJS

###React
I already had some skill in react but this project allowed me to gain a better understanding of how react can be used with an api and information from a database that updates 

###NodeJS
I learned  how to create a backend in this project using node and projects to create models, routes, endpoints

###CSSTransitions
This is a great package that I saw in this project for transitions of components which is amazing to use for easy transitions 

###Redux
This was my first experience with Redux using global state. I learned about stores, reducers and actions. Redux can be a very useful tool but does not seem to be strictly necessary in every project. Global state is very handy to have when there is a lot of information in state but is not stricly necessary for small scale projects.

###Thunk


###Axios


###Bootstrap
This was my first time using Bootstrap and it is an amazing package that makes designing a webpage so much easier. It has a lot of handy components that allow you to focus on designing the architecture of an app rather than worrying about something like a toggle 

###reactbootstrap
Allows bootstrap to work with react - a must have

###Heroku
This was also my first time deploying a page to the internet fully. Heroku made it simple. all it required was git remote and to push a build. Heroku is definetl something that I will use more often in my deevelopment career

###Concurrently
This is another first time package that allows server and client to run at the same time when in a dev environment. Another must have that will be used a lot more.
